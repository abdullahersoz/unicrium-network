## ⚠️ **MINOR FINDINGS**

### 1. Address Validation (LOW SEVERITY)
**Issue:** Models require valid checksummed addresses  
**Impact:** May reject valid addresses in some cases  
**Status:** Design choice, not a bug  
**Recommendation:** Document address format requirements

### 2. Crypto Module Method Name (COSMETIC)
**Issue:** `get_address()` method name not consistent  
**Impact:** None (internal implementation)  
**Status:** Minor naming inconsistency  
**Recommendation:** Standardize method names in future version

---

## 💡 **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### High Priority
1. ✅ Deploy to testnet first
2. ✅ Monitor for 1-2 weeks
3. ✅ Test with real validators
4. ✅ Stress test with high load

### Medium Priority
1. ⚠️ Add more comprehensive unit tests
2. ⚠️ Implement transaction mempool limits
3. ⚠️ Add metrics/monitoring dashboard
4. ⚠️ Setup alerting for critical events

### Low Priority  
1. 📝 Standardize naming conventions
2. 📝 Add more inline documentation
3. 📝 Create validator onboarding guide
4. 📝 Build block explorer

---

## 🔧 **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**

1. **Single Node:**  
   Current implementation tested on single node only.  
   Multi-node P2P needs additional testing.

2. **Testnet Phase:**  
   Recommend extended testnet period (2-4 weeks)  
   before mainnet launch.

3. **Monitoring:**  
   Production monitoring tools not yet integrated.  
   Recommend Prometheus/Grafana setup.
